This is my home for various C snippets related to teaching myself C and algorithms from
the book "Essential Algorithms - A practical approach to Computer Algorithms" by Rod Stephens.
ISBN: 978-1-118-61210-1
And also "The C programming language, second edition" by Kernighan and Ritchie.
And also also "Foundations of Computer Science C edition" by Aho and Ullman
ISBN: 0-7167-8284-7

And whatever else I'm mucking about with trying to improve my C skills.
